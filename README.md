# **Security Notes**

*Some notes I took while taking different courses*

---

## Overview

This repository contains my personal, (un)structured notes from preparing for:

* **HTB CPTS** (Certified Penetration Testing Specialist)
* **INE eJPT** (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)

The notes are written in Markdown and optimized for **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** as a local knowledge base, but can also be read in any Markdown viewer.

These documents consolidate methodologies, commands, and payloads for **penetration testing, red teaming, and capture-the-flag (CTF) workflows**.

## Content Structure

### **HTB CPTS Notes** (`/CPTS-EN 1`)

Covers:

* Privilege escalation (Linux & Windows)
* Web exploitation (XSS, SQLi, command injection, etc.)
* Active Directory enumeration & exploitation
* Password attacks & credential harvesting
* File transfer & tunneling techniques
* Service-specific enumeration checklists
* Miscellaneous red team tips & scripts

### **INE eJPT Notes** (`/eJPT-EN 1`)

Covers:

* Information gathering & reconnaissance
* Footprinting & scanning workflows
* Enumeration strategies
* Vulnerability assessment and exploitation basics

---

## Usage

* Best viewed in **Obsidian** for navigation, backlinking, and graph view.
* Compatible with any Markdown editor — may require manual image linking if outside Obsidian.
* Always **validate techniques** in a safe, authorized environment before operational use.

## Disclaimer

These notes are for **educational purposes only**.
All techniques described should be executed **only** in environments where you have **explicit permission** (client engagements, labs, or CTFs).
Some material may become outdated as tools and exploits evolve — verify commands before use.

This style makes it look like a **serious technical reference** rather than a casual learning diary.
If you want, I can also **auto-generate a clickable table of contents** for all your topics so visitors can instantly jump to any section. That would make this repo look like a polished pentest handbook.
