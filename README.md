# CHarr-SecurityNotes

notes? yeah. just notes.

> Note : These notes are made to be opened with obsidian, and are not optimised for github viewing ( i also didn't include images).

This repo is a messy (but functional) dump of everything I’ve learned while grinding HTB’s CPTS cert and messing around with random vuln labs. Expect nmap flags, priv esc tricks, web stuff, injection payloads, AD enum, and more markdown than any normal person should write.

**me:** writes notes  
**also me:** forgets I wrote them and googles it again anyway

### 🗂 Where The Huzz At?

[HTB CPTS](https://academy.hackthebox.com/exams/3) Notes :  
👉 [`/CPTS-EN 1`](./CPTS-EN%201)  

That includes:
- Privilege escalation (Linux & Windows)
- Web attacks (XSS, SQLi, command injection, etc.)
- Active Directory enum & exploitation
- Password attacks, file transfer tricks, and cheatsheets
- Enumeration techniques per service
- Random stuff I didn’t know where to file

If it sounds useful, it probably is. If it sounds wrong, it might be. These notes are for me first, but if they help you too that's cool.

[INE eJPT](https://ine.com/security/certifications/ejpt-certification) Notes :  
👉 [`/eJPT-EN 1`](./eJPT-EN%201)  

That includes:
- Information Gathering 
- Footprinting & Scanning
- Enumeration
- Vulnerability assessment

thats quite it !
> Please note these notes were mostly made my 13 year old me, and WILL contain mistakes (and very bad english, maybe even cringe jokes) !
> When reading these, keep in mind it was made by a kid, and won't be as "okay-ish" as the CPTS ones.

### 🧠 Why Bother?

Because I forget things. And because it’s kinda fun writing it all down.

Some of this might be outdated or broken (or just false). I wrote these while learning, which means there are probably errors, oversights, and weird formatting choices. Use at your own risk. Or don’t.

But if it helps you pop a shell faster, you’re welcome.
Still jobless atm btw. Hmu if you’re into hiring people like me (🥀🥀💔💔).
