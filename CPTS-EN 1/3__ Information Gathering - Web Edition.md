### Active Reconnaissance

In active reconnaissance, the attacker `directly interacts with the target system` to gather information. This interaction can take various forms:

|Technique|Description|Example|Tools|Risk of Detection|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`Port Scanning`|Identifying open ports and services running on the target.|Using Nmap to scan a web server for open ports like 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).|Nmap, Masscan, Unicornscan|High: Direct interaction with the target can trigger intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls.|
|`Vulnerability Scanning`|Probing the target for known vulnerabilities, such as outdated software or misconfigurations.|Running Nessus against a web application to check for SQL injection flaws or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.|Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto|High: Vulnerability scanners send exploit payloads that security solutions can detect.|
|`Network Mapping`|Mapping the target's network topology, including connected devices and their relationships.|Using traceroute to determine the path packets take to reach the target server, revealing potential network hops and infrastructure.|Traceroute, Nmap|Medium to High: Excessive or unusual network traffic can raise suspicion.|
|`Banner Grabbing`|Retrieving information from banners displayed by services running on the target.|Connecting to a web server on port 80 and examining the HTTP banner to identify the web server software and version.|Netcat, curl|Low: Banner grabbing typically involves minimal interaction but can still be logged.|
|`OS Fingerprinting`|Identifying the operating system running on the target.|Using Nmap's OS detection capabilities (`-O`) to determine if the target is running Windows, Linux, or another OS.|Nmap, Xprobe2|Low: OS fingerprinting is usually passive, but some advanced techniques can be detected.|
|`Service Enumeration`|Determining the specific versions of services running on open ports.|Using Nmap's service version detection (`-sV`) to determine if a web server is running Apache 2.4.50 or Nginx 1.18.0.|Nmap|Low: Similar to banner grabbing, service enumeration can be logged but is less likely to trigger alerts.|
|`Web Spidering`|Crawling the target website to identify web pages, directories, and files.|Running a web crawler like Burp Suite Spider or OWASP ZAP Spider to map out the structure of a website and discover hidden resources.|Burp Suite Spider, OWASP ZAP Spider, Scrapy (customisable)|Low to Medium: Can be detected if the crawler's behaviour is not carefully configured to mimic legitimate traffic.|

Active reconnaissance provides a direct and often more comprehensive view of the target's infrastructure and security posture. However, it also carries a higher risk of detection, as the interactions with the target can trigger alerts or raise suspicion.

### Passive Reconnaissance

In contrast, passive reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target `without directly interacting` with it. This relies on analysing publicly available information and resources, such as:

|Technique|Description|Example|Tools|Risk of Detection|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`Search Engine Queries`|Utilising search engines to uncover information about the target, including websites, social media profiles, and news articles.|Searching Google for "`[Target Name] employees`" to find employee information or social media profiles.|Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, and specialised search engines (e.g., Shodan)|Very Low: Search engine queries are normal internet activity and unlikely to trigger alerts.|
|`WHOIS Lookups`|Querying WHOIS databases to retrieve domain registration details.|Performing a WHOIS lookup on a target domain to find the registrant's name, contact information, and name servers.|whois command-line tool, online WHOIS lookup services|Very Low: WHOIS queries are legitimate and do not raise suspicion.|
|`DNS`|Analysing DNS records to identify subdomains, mail servers, and other infrastructure.|Using `dig` to enumerate subdomains of a target domain.|dig, nslookup, host, dnsenum, fierce, dnsrecon|Very Low: DNS queries are essential for internet browsing and are not typically flagged as suspicious.|
|`Web Archive Analysis`|Examining historical snapshots of the target's website to identify changes, vulnerabilities, or hidden information.|Using the Wayback Machine to view past versions of a target website to see how it has changed over time.|Wayback Machine|Very Low: Accessing archived versions of websites is a normal activity.|
|`Social Media Analysis`|Gathering information from social media platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook.|Searching LinkedIn for employees of a target organisation to learn about their roles, responsibilities, and potential social engineering targets.|LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, specialised OSINT tools|Very Low: Accessing public social media profiles is not considered intrusive.|
|`Code Repositories`|Analysing publicly accessible code repositories like GitHub for exposed credentials or vulnerabilities.|Searching GitHub for code snippets or repositories related to the target that might contain sensitive information or code vulnerabilities.|GitHub, GitLab|Very Low: Code repositories are meant for public access, and searching them is not suspicious.|

Passive reconnaissance is generally considered stealthier and less likely to trigger alarms than active reconnaissance. However, it may yield less comprehensive information, as it relies on what's already publicly accessible.


## WHOIS Lookup

> `whois <FQDN/IP>




Each WHOIS record typically contains the following information:

- `Domain Name`: The domain name itself (e.g., example.com)
- `Registrar`: The company where the domain was registered (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap)
- `Registrant Contact`: The person or organization that registered the domain.
- `Administrative Contact`: The person responsible for managing the domain.
- `Technical Contact`: The person handling technical issues related to the domain.
- `Creation and Expiration Dates`: When the domain was registered and when it's set to expire.
- `Name Servers`: Servers that translate the domain name into an IP address.


- `Identifying Key Personnel`: WHOIS records often reveal the names, email addresses, and phone numbers of individuals responsible for managing the domain. This information can be leveraged for social engineering attacks or to identify potential targets for phishing campaigns.
- `Discovering Network Infrastructure`: Technical details like name servers and IP addresses provide clues about the target's network infrastructure. This can help penetration testers identify potential entry points or misconfigurations.
- `Historical Data Analysis`: Accessing historical WHOIS records through services like [WhoisFreaks](https://whoisfreaks.com/) can reveal changes in ownership, contact information, or technical details over time. This can be useful for tracking the evolution of the target's digital presence.

The WHOIS record reveals the following:

- `Registration Date`: The domain was registered just a few days ago.
- `Registrant`: The registrant's information is hidden behind a privacy service.
- `Name Servers`: The name servers are associated with a known bulletproof hosting provider often used for malicious activities.
- 

## DNS - Domain Name System
|DNS Concept|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`Domain Name`|A human-readable label for a website or other internet resource.|`www.example.com`|
|`IP Address`|A unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to the internet.|`192.0.2.1`|
|`DNS Resolver`|A server that translates domain names into IP addresses.|Your ISP's DNS server or public resolvers like Google DNS (`8.8.8.8`)|
|`Root Name Server`|The top-level servers in the DNS hierarchy.|There are 13 root servers worldwide, named A-M: `a.root-servers.net`|
|`TLD Name Server`|Servers responsible for specific top-level domains (e.g., .com, .org).|[Verisign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisign) for `.com`, [PIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Interest_Registry) for `.org`|
|`Authoritative Name Server`|The server that holds the actual IP address for a domain.|Often managed by hosting providers or domain registrars.|
|`DNS Record Types`|Different types of information stored in DNS.|A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, etc.|

|Record Type|Full Name|Description|Zone File Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|`A`|Address Record|Maps a hostname to its IPv4 address.|`www.example.com.` IN A `192.0.2.1`|
|`AAAA`|IPv6 Address Record|Maps a hostname to its IPv6 address.|`www.example.com.` IN AAAA `2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334`|
|`CNAME`|Canonical Name Record|Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.|`blog.example.com.` IN CNAME `webserver.example.net.`|
|`MX`|Mail Exchange Record|Specifies the mail server(s) responsible for handling email for the domain.|`example.com.` IN MX 10 `mail.example.com.`|
|`NS`|Name Server Record|Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.|`example.com.` IN NS `ns1.example.com.`|
|`TXT`|Text Record|Stores arbitrary text information, often used for domain verification or security policies.|`example.com.` IN TXT `"v=spf1 mx -all"` (SPF record)|
|`SOA`|Start of Authority Record|Specifies administrative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, responsible person's email, and other parameters.|`example.com.` IN SOA `ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. 2024060301 10800 3600 604800 86400`|
|`SRV`|Service Record|Defines the hostname and port number for specific services.|`_sip._udp.example.com.` IN SRV 10 5 5060 `sipserver.example.com.`|
|`PTR`|Pointer Record|Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a hostname.|`1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.` IN PTR `www.example.com.`|

- `Uncovering Assets`: DNS records can reveal a wealth of information, including subdomains, mail servers, and name server records. For instance, a `CNAME` record pointing to an outdated server (`dev.example.com` CNAME `oldserver.example.net`) could lead to a vulnerable system.
- `Mapping the Network Infrastructure`: You can create a comprehensive map of the target's network infrastructure by analysing DNS data. For example, identifying the name servers (`NS` records) for a domain can reveal the hosting provider used, while an `A` record for `loadbalancer.example.com` can pinpoint a load balancer. This helps you understand how different systems are connected, identify traffic flow, and pinpoint potential choke points or weaknesses that could be exploited during a penetration test.
- `Monitoring for Changes`: Continuously monitoring DNS records can reveal changes in the target's infrastructure over time. For example, the sudden appearance of a new subdomain (`vpn.example.com`) might indicate a new entry point into the network, while a `TXT` record containing a value like `_1password=...` strongly suggests the organization is using 1Password, which could be leveraged for social engineering attacks or targeted phishing campaigns.

#understand-dig-output

1. Header
    
    - `;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 16449`: This line indicates the type of query (`QUERY`), the successful status (`NOERROR`), and a unique identifier (`16449`) for this specific query.
        
        - `;; flags: qr rd ad; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0`: This describes the flags in the DNS header:
            - `qr`: Query Response flag - indicates this is a response.
            - `rd`: Recursion Desired flag - means recursion was requested.
            - `ad`: Authentic Data flag - means the resolver considers the data authentic.
            - The remaining numbers indicate the number of entries in each section of the DNS response: 1 question, 1 answer, 0 authority records, and 0 additional records.
    - `;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available`: This indicates that recursion was requested, but the server does not support it.
        
2. Question Section
    
    - `;google.com. IN A`: This line specifies the question: "What is the IPv4 address (A record) for `google.com`?"
3. Answer Section
    
    - `google.com. 0 IN A 142.251.47.142`: This is the answer to the query. It indicates that the IP address associated with `google.com` is `142.251.47.142`. The '`0`' represents the `TTL` (time-to-live), indicating how long the result can be cached before being refreshed.
4. Footer
    
    - `;; Query time: 0 msec`: This shows the time it took for the query to be processed and the response to be received (0 milliseconds).
        
    - `;; SERVER: 172.23.176.1#53(172.23.176.1) (UDP)`: This identifies the DNS server that provided the answer and the protocol used (UDP).
        
    - `;; WHEN: Thu Jun 13 10:45:58 SAST 2024`: This is the timestamp of when the query was made.
        
    - `;; MSG SIZE rcvd: 54`: This indicates the size of the DNS message received (54 bytes).
        

An `opt pseudosection` can sometimes exist in a `dig` query. This is due to Extension Mechanisms for DNS (`EDNS`), which allows for additional features such as larger message sizes and DNS Security Extensions (`DNSSEC`) support.

## Subdomains
1. `Wordlist Selection`: The process begins with selecting a wordlist containing potential subdomain names. These wordlists can be:
    - `General-Purpose`: Containing a broad range of common subdomain names (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `blog`, `mail`, `admin`, `test`). This approach is useful when you don't know the target's naming conventions.
    - `Targeted`: Focused on specific industries, technologies, or naming patterns relevant to the target. This approach is more efficient and reduces the chances of false positives.
    - `Custom`: You can create your own wordlist based on specific keywords, patterns, or intelligence gathered from other sources.
2. `Iteration and Querying`: A script or tool iterates through the wordlist, appending each word or phrase to the main domain (e.g., `example.com`) to create potential subdomain names (e.g., `dev.example.com`, `staging.example.com`).
3. `DNS Lookup`: A DNS query is performed for each potential subdomain to check if it resolves to an IP address. This is typically done using the A or AAAA record type.
4. `Filtering and Validation`: If a subdomain resolves successfully, it's added to a list of valid subdomains. Further validation steps might be taken to confirm the subdomain's existence and functionality (e.g., by attempting to access it through a web browser).

### DNSEnum

`dnsenum` is a versatile and widely-used command-line tool written in Perl. It is a comprehensive toolkit for DNS reconnaissance, providing various functionalities to gather information about a target domain's DNS infrastructure and potential subdomains. The tool offers several key functions:

- `DNS Record Enumeration`: `dnsenum` can retrieve various DNS records, including A, AAAA, NS, MX, and TXT records, providing a comprehensive overview of the target's DNS configuration.
- `Zone Transfer Attempts`: The tool automatically attempts zone transfers from discovered name servers. While most servers are configured to prevent unauthorised zone transfers, a successful attempt can reveal a treasure trove of DNS information.
- `Subdomain Brute-Forcing`: `dnsenum` supports brute-force enumeration of subdomains using a wordlist. This involves systematically testing potential subdomain names against the target domain to identify valid ones.
- `Google Scraping`: The tool can scrape Google search results to find additional subdomains that might not be listed in DNS records directly.
- `Reverse Lookup`: `dnsenum` can perform reverse DNS lookups to identify domains associated with a given IP address, potentially revealing other websites hosted on the same server.
- `WHOIS Lookups`: The tool can also perform WHOIS queries to gather information about domain ownership and registration details.

```bash
dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com -f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -r
```
In this command:

- `dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com`: We specify the target domain we want to enumerate, along with a shortcut for some tuning options ``--enum`.
- `-f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt`: We indicate the path to the SecLists wordlist we'll use for brute-forcing. Adjust the path if your SecLists installation is different.
- `-r`: This option enables recursive subdomain brute-forcing, meaning that if `dnsenum` finds a subdomain, it will then try to enumerate subdomains of that subdomain.

1. `Zone Transfer Request (AXFR)`: The secondary DNS server initiates the process by sending a zone transfer request to the primary server. This request typically uses the AXFR (Full Zone Transfer) type.
2. `SOA Record Transfer`: Upon receiving the request (and potentially authenticating the secondary server), the primary server responds by sending its Start of Authority (SOA) record. The SOA record contains vital information about the zone, including its serial number, which helps the secondary server determine if its zone data is current.
3. `DNS Records Transmission`: The primary server then transfers all the DNS records in the zone to the secondary server, one by one. This includes records like A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, NS, and others that define the domain's subdomains, mail servers, name servers, and other configurations.
4. `Zone Transfer Complete`: Once all records have been transmitted, the primary server signals the end of the zone transfer. This notification informs the secondary server that it has received a complete copy of the zone data.
5. `Acknowledgement (ACK)`: The secondary server sends an acknowledgement message to the primary server, confirming the successful receipt and processing of the zone data. This completes the zone transfer process.
